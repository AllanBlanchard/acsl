\chapter*{Foreword}

% This is a preliminary design of the ACSL language, a deliverable of
% the task 7.2 of the ANR RNTL project CAT
% (\url{http://www.rntl.org/projet/resume2005/cat.htm}). In this
% project, a reference implementation of ACSL is provided: the Frama-C
% platform (\url{http://frama-c.cea.fr}).

This document describes version \version{} of the ANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL). 
The language features may still evolve in the future. 
In particular, some features in this document
are considered \emph{experimental}, meaning that their syntax and
semantics is not yet fixed.  
These features are marked with
\experimental.  
They must also be considered advanced features,
which are not needed for basic use of this
specification language.
