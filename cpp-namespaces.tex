\index{namespaces}

C++ introduced namespaces as a means to structure the scopes of declared names. Namespaces apply equivalently to \NAME{} 
names. In particular,
\begin{itemize}
\item Any \NAME{} construct that may be declared or defined 
in global scope may be declared or defined within a namespace.
\item Identifiers for such constructs may be constructed using namespaces names and \lstinline|::| tokens, just as for \lang{} names.
\item Name resolution of \NAME{} names is performed just as for \lang{} names, with \NAME{} names being in scope only within \NAME{} annotations.
\item It is preferable to avoid using names declared in \lang{} as the names of \NAME{} constructs as well. However, since namespaces can be extended, the author of \NAME{} annotations may not know about the \lang{} names that may be added in a namespace extension. Thus ambiguities can in
principle arise: a \lang{} declaration and an \NAME{}
declaration may be equally applicable to a use of that name 
in some \NAME{} construct. In that case the \NAME{} declaration applies.
Tools may wish to emit warnings for such cases.

\TODO{This rule for ambiguity resolution is open for discussion.}
\end{itemize}
