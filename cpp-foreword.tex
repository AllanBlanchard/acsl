\chapter*{Foreword [C++]}

% This is a preliminary design of the ACSL language, a deliverable of
% the task 7.2 of the ANR RNTL project CAT
% (\url{http://www.rntl.org/projet/resume2005/cat.htm}). In this
% project, a reference implementation of ACSL is provided: the Frama-C
% platform (\url{http://frama-c.cea.fr}).

This document describes version \version{} of the ANSI/ISO C++ Specification Language (\NAME). 
The language features will evolve in the future. 
In particular, some features in this document
are considered \emph{experimental}, meaning that their syntax and
semantics is not yet fixed.  
These features are marked with
\experimental.  
They must also be considered advanced features,
which are not needed for basic use of this
specification language.

\section*{Acknowledgements [C++]}

This language design and document draw heavily from the 
ACSL language and documentation; many portions of the text
are explicitly shared. Thus we acknowledge the extensive
set of collaborators and commenters on ACSL that are listed
in the companion ACSL documentation.

The design of \NAME~also draws from the specification
languages of other programming languages, such as Java \cite{leavens00jml}.

The following have contributed explicitly to the formation of
this document and the design of \NAME~itself.
We gratefully thank all the people who contributed to this document:
