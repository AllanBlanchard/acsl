\section{Specification Templates}\label{sec:spec-templ}
This section describes some common issues that may occur when writing
an ACSL specification and proposes some solution to overcome them

\subsection{Accessing a C variable that is masked}

The situation may happen where it is necessary to refer
in an annotation to a C variable that is masked at that point.
For instance,
a function contract may need to refer to a global variable that has the
same name as a function parameter, as in the following code:

\listinginput{1}{glob_var_masked.c}

In order to write the \verb|assigns| clause for \verb|f|, we must
access the global variable \verb|x|, since \verb|f| calls \verb|g|,
which can modify \verb|x|. This is not possible with C scoping rules,
as \verb|x| refers to the parameter of \verb|f| in the scope of the
function.

A solution is to use a ghost pointer to \verb|x|, as shown in
the following code:

\listinginput{1}{glob_var_masked_sol.c}
