\chapter{Conclusion}

This document presents a Behavioral Interface Specification Language
for ANSI \lang{} source code. It provides a common basis that can be
shared among different tools.
The specification language described here is intended to evolve in the
future and remain open to additional constructions.
One interesting possible extension regards ``temporal''
properties in a large sense, such as liveness properties, which can
sometimes be simulated by regular specifications with ghost
variables~\cite{giorgetti06fase}, or properties on evolution of data
over the time, such as the history constraints of JML, or in the Lustre
assertion language.
