\chapter{Conclusion}

This document presents an Executable ANSI/ISO C Specification Language. It
provides a subset of \acsl~\cite{acsl} implemented in the \framac
platform~\cite{framac} in which each construct may be evaluated at runtime. The
specification language descrided here is intented to evolve in future in two
directions. First it is based on \acsl which is still evolving. Second the
considered subset of \acsl may also changed.
