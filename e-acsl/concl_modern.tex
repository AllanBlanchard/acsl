\chapter{Conclusion}

This document presents an Executable ANSI/ISO C Specification
Language. It provides a subset of \acsl~\cite{acsl} implemented in the
\framac platform~\cite{framac} in which each construct may be
evaluated at runtime. The specification language described here is
intented to evolve in the future in two directions. First it is based
on \acsl which is itself still evolving. Second the considered subset
of \acsl may also change.
