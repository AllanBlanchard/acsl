\chapter{Introduction}

This document is a reference manual for
\ifthenelse{\boolean{PrintImplementationRq}}%
{the E-ACSL implementation provided by the Frama-C
  framework~\cite{frama-c}.}%
{E-ACSL.}
E-ACSL is an acronym for ``Executable ANSI/ISO C
Specification Language''. It is an ``executable'' subset of
ACSL~\cite{acsl} implemented in the \framac platform~\cite{framac}. Contrary to
ACSL, each E-ACSL specification is executable: it may be evaluated at runtime.

In this document, we assume that the reader has a good knowledge of both
ACSL~\cite{acsl} and the ANSI C programming language~\cite{KR88,standardc99}.

\section{Organization of this document}

This document is organized in the very same way that the reference manual of
ACSL~\cite{acsl}.

Instead of being a fully new reference manual, this document points out the
differences between E-ACSL and ACSL. Each E-ACSL construct which is not pointed
out must be considered to have the very same semantics than its ACSL
counterpart. For clarity, each relevant grammar rules are given in BNF form
in separate figures like the \acsl reference manual does.
