\section{Automatic type inference [C++]}
\label{sec:auto}
\index{auto}

Beginning with C++11\footnote{Prior to C++11, \lstinline|auto| had a different meaning}, \lang{} permits designating the type of a variable as
\lstinline|auto|.
 \lstinline|auto| may also be used as part of a type, as in \lstinline|auto*| or \lstinline|const auto[]|. In these cases the compiler performs type inference, producing a compile-time type and
saving the user from having to write out the type.

A second use of \lstinline|auto| is as a simple way of keeping the types
within some code flexible. For example, one might write
\begin{lstlisting}
auto f(int x) {
   auto y = ... computation involving x ...
   auto z = .. more computation using x and y ...
   return z;
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here the return type depends on the type of \lstinline|x| but is not hard-coded into the body of \lstinline|f|. If one changes the declared type of
\lstinline|x| to say \lstinline|double|, all the inferred types change without needing further editing.

The disadvantage of \lstinline|auto| is of course, that although the 
program is still strongly typed, the actual types are harder for the reader to discern.

\lstinline|auto| is also permitted within \NAME{} text, where the type can be inferred at compile time. The inferred type may be a logic type. For example, in
\begin{lstlisting}
//@ logic auto f(integer i) = i + 1;
\end{lstlisting}
the result type can be inferred to be \lstinline|integer|.

Within \NAME{} specification text, the \lstinline|auto| keyword can be used in these locations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item As the result type in a logic function declaration
	\item as the variable type in a ghost declaration
	\item \emph{More?}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Needs grammar additions}
