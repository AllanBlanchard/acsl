  This paper introduces a methodology to perform formal verification
  of floating-point C programs. It extends an existing tool for the
  verification of C programs, Caduceus, with new annotations specific
  to floating-point arithmetic. The Caduceus first-order logic model
  for C programs is extended accordingly. Then verification conditions
  expressing the correctness of the programs are obtained in the usual
  way and can be discharged interactively with the Coq proof
  assistant, using an existing Coq formalization of floating-point
  arithmetic.  This methodology is already implemented and has been
  successfully applied to several short floating-point programs, which
  are presented in this paper.}
