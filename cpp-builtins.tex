Also, though typically \lang classes and functions are not defined within
\NAME, some such helper functions are recognized. They are the following:

\begin{listing-nonumber}
bool std::is_same<typename T1, typename T2>::value ;
\end{listing-nonumber}


It is expected that additional items from \lstinline|<type_traits>| will be added in the future.
